                            College Prep at Penn Charter was developed by educators from William Penn Charter School
                            and Simon Gratz High School. In 1971 Penn Charter teacher Joe Perrot was
                            inspired to call Marcus Foster, the principal of Simon Gratz High School on Hunting Park
                            Avenue. Recognizing the close proximity of the two schools, he proposed a program
                            that would make Penn Charterâ€™s resources available to Gratz students who wanted to
                            pursue college. Since that time, College Prep has hosted students from Gratz and other
                            neighborhood public high schools each summer for a program that develops their
                            skills and supports their aspirations. College Prep students are exclusively from
                            Philadelphia public and charter schools. In the past 48 years College Prep has worked
                            with over 1,000 students in Philadelphia, many of whom have spent two summers committed
                            to the program.
